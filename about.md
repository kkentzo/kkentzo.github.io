Hi there and welcome to my blog! I am a computer scientist with
previous experience in [academic
research](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=-AYr7GAAAAAJ&hl=en)
and the industry, currently working as a software engineer / architect
in the energy sector.

I am comfortable working across the full spectrum of the software
development process including its "hard" (engineering, architecture,
streamlining operations) and "soft" (team management, productivity,
communication, learning and self-improvement) aspects.

This is the place where I am going to be writing about topics that I
am interested at mostly focused around technology. These include
emacs, golang, C, ruby, devops, productivity etc.

Feel free to contact me through my
[professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkentzo) and
[github](https://github.com/kkentzo) profiles.
