Hi there and welcome to my blog! I am a computer scientist with
previous experience in [academic
research](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=-AYr7GAAAAAJ&hl=en),
currently working as a software engineer / architect / project manager
in the travel industry.

This is the place where I am going to be writing mostly about
technical topics that I am interested at (emacs, golang, ruby, lisp
etc.).

Feel free to contact me through my
[professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkentzo) and
[github](https://github.com/kkentzo) profiles.
